# AddBin Option

The AddBin option adds the selected member to Git in binary format and tags the OMVS file copy of the member as binary. The .gitattributes file is updated with the OMVS directory and file name so that Git always treats it as binary. This is useful for object decks and other data that should never be converted from EBCDIC to ASCII and back.
