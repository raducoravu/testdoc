# Overview \(What You Should Know but May Not\)

Git is a distributed version control system that has been very popular in the distributed environment. Thanks to the great team over at Rocket Software, it is available \(and has been for a few years\) for the z/OS environment. The main drawback to using it has been that there has not been a user-friendly, mainframe-based solution until now. ZIGI allows the mainframe developer to participate in the world of Git. There is a wealth of information available on Git â€” just open your favorite browser and do a search or go directly to github.com where free accounts are available along with many open source projects such as this one.

ZIGI was developed to provide the mainframe developer with a user-friendly interface to Git that works the way any other mainframe user interface works, making it possible for the developer to continue to use the development tools that are familiar, easy to use, and which enhances their productivity. That means that all of the ISPF capabilities are available to the ZIGI user as well as the ability to integrate their SCM requirements using Git.
