# Select Command

For those who donâ€™t want to tab to a row, move the cursor to a row, use point-and-shoot, or enter S to select a repository, there is a command option to directly select a repository to be opened.

Syntax: Select repository-name

Select may be abbreviated as S and must be followed by the repository name. For the Select command, the search is case insensitive.
