# Config

This command allows you to view and update, if desired, your username and e-mail, the PDSE member generations default, and the display options pop-up. Another option that is configured here is the option to bypass being asked if a file extension should be used for all members of the added PDS when the members are copied to the repositories OMVS filesystem.

In the future, this is also where other, user-customizable options can be configured. At this point, the Member Generations should be 0 unless there is a tool available that can work with Member Generations \(see [PDSEGEN](https://github.com/lbdyck/pdsegen) for an open-source solution\).
