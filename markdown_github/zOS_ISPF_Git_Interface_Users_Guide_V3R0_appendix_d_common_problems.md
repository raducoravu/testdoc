# Appendix D: Common Problems

This is a partial list of common problems the ZIGI user may encounter:

-   Failure in the cp command attempting to copy a z/OS dataset, or z/OS partitioned dataset member, to USS. This is typically caused by the z/OS dataset being opened \(e.g. ISPF Browse\).
-   Failure using the Clone or Remote ZIGI commands due to an access failure. This may be caused by the users ssh public key for the active LPAR not being registered with the remote server.
