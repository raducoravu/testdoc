# Adding a Remote Repository

ZIGI currently only supports a single “remote” \(named origin\) per repository. Once you have a local repository, you can use the “remote” command to add this \(single\) remote to your local repository. To do so, the remote repository \(GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.\) needs to associate the public part of your \(Mainframe\) ssh-key-pair with the userID for the remote repository service.

Once you’ve set up the repository on the remote side, you can add the remote within ZIGI. A “push –u origin master” is performed.
