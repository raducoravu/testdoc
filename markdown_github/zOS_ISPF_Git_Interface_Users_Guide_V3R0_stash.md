# Stash

Stash saves \(pushes\) your current git workspace and restore the workspace to the last commit level. This allows you to quickly switch what youâ€™re working on and work on something else without forcing a commit. NOTE: A stash is never pushed to the remote server.

Stash asks for a short description since you may have multiple stashes in your project.
