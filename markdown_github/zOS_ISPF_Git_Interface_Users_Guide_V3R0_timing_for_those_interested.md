# Timing \(For Those Interested\)

For those who may be interested in some of the internal timings, it is as easy as allocating a DD with the name of ZIGIDEBG. When ZIGI runs, time stamps for various routines and functions are recorded in a file in the userâ€™s home directory. When ZIGI ends, if the DD was allocated, the file is listed in UDList:

The file may be browsed, viewed, edited, or deleted.

The active debug log may be viewed from several of the panels \(Local Repository, Current Repository, and PDS Member List\) by using the **VIEWD** command.

For those interested, here is a short EXEC that allocates and/or frees the ZIGIDEBG DD:

/\* ------------------- REXX ---------------------- \*

\| A toggle exec that will allocate the ZIGIDEBG DD \|

\| if it does not exist and if it does then it will \|

\| be freed. \|

\* ------------------------------------------------ \*/

x = listdsi\('ZIGIDEBG' 'FILE'\)

if x \> 0 then if sysreason = 3 then 'Free F\(ZIGIDEBG\)'

else 'Alloc f\(zigidebg\) dummy reuse'
