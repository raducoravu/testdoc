# Pop Conflict Resolution

There are two potential solutions that may be used to create a clean workspace:

1.  Create a new stash from the workspace, and then pop the desired stash.
2.  Perform the following actions:
    1.  AddAll to add all untracked and modified datasets and files to the Git index staging area.
    2.  Commit those changes

After performing either of the above, the pop should work.
